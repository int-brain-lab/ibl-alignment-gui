# ibl-alignment-gui

A pyqt based GUI for aligning electrophysiology recordings using anatomical landmarks. The tool allows electrophysiology 
features recorded from neural probes to be aligned to anatomical histology landmarks in order to better locate the position 
of recording electrodes in the brain.

This project is maintained by the software development team at the International Brain Lab.
